# Markdown

*Markdown* is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.[9] Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

Since the initial description of Markdown[10] contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, the implementations that appeared over the years have subtle differences and many come with syntax extensions.
